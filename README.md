# In this stage, you should implement various other scientific approaches to calculate a readability score.

Take a look at different ages and corresponding scores in the table in ARI article on Wikipedia. This table is suitable for all the algorithms described in this stage. To calculate the age, use the upper bound of the range. For example, if the range is 12-13-year-olds then it's upper bound is 13-year-olds.

The first algorithm is Flesch–Kincaid readability tests. First, you need to create a method that calculates the number of syllables in a word. The formula is given below. You can find more information in the corresponding article on Wikipedia. You can use the second formula to calculate the index; it allows you to easily calculate the age of a person using the same table from the Automated Readability Index.

score=0.39∗words/sentences+11.8∗syllables/words−15.59

The second one is SMOG index. It stands for Simple Measure of Gobbledygook. To calculate it, you need to count the number of polysyllables, which is the number of words with more than 2 syllables. The formula is shown below. You can find out more in the Wikipedia article on SMOG. The article says that at least 30 sentences are required for this index to work properly. Don't pay attention to this, just keep it in mind when you use this index in real life. As in the previous example, the grade level is calculated here, so to get the age of a person you need to use the table from the first link.

score=1.043∗sqrt(polysyllables∗30/sentences) + 3.1291

The next one is Coleman–Liau index. The formula is given below. For more information, read the article on Wikipedia. L is the average number of characters per 100 words and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words. Like all other indices, the output is a person's grade level. Like all other indices, the result is a minimum grade level required to understand this text.

score=0.0588∗L−0.296∗S−15.8

So, in this stage, you should program all three approaches. Don't forget about the Automated readability index! Also, there should be an option to choose all methods at the same time.

To count the number of syllables you should use letters a, e, i, o, u, y as vowels. In the short article on Vowels on Wikipedia you can see examples and intricacies with determining vowels in a word with 100% accuracy. So, let's use the following 4 rules:

1. Count the number of vowels in the word.
2. Do not count double-vowels (for example, "rain" has 2 vowels but only 1 syllable).
3. If the last letter in the word is 'e' do not count it as a vowel (for example, "side" has 1 syllable).
4. If at the end it turns out that the word contains 0 vowels, then consider this word as a 1-syllable one.

Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Words: 137
Sentences: 14
Characters: 687
Syllables: 210
Polysyllables: 17
Enter the score you want to calculate (ARI, FK, SMOG, CL, all): all

Automated Readability Index: 7.08 (about 13-year-olds).
Flesch–Kincaid readability tests: 6.31 (about 12-year-olds).
Simple Measure of Gobbledygook: 9.42 (about 15-year-olds).
Coleman–Liau index: 10.66 (about 17-year-olds).

This text should be understood in average by 14.25-year-olds.
